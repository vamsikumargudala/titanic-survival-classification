# Titanic Survival Classification

This project predicts passenger survival in the Titanic dataset using machine learning algorithms.

## Contents

- `titanic-survival-classification.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook with EDA, feature engineering, and ML model code.
- `titanic_data.csv`: Dataset used for training and evaluation.

## Problem Summary

Can we predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on features like age, gender, passenger class, etc.?

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
3. Run all cells. Change the data path if needed.
